# The-Overlay-Den
Welcome to The Overlay Den! This project was created as a hub for people to find Overlays for RetroArch, RetroPie, Lakka and Batocera! The project was hugely inspired by the work of Mr Overlay, and i hope you enjoy! We also have a Discord server where you can talk to other fellow Overlay Makers, simply keep updated on any new Overlays, or ask for help with making your own Overlay. The link can be found below.

I cannot thank Darren (Mr Overlay himself) enough for helping me get started on Overlay making, and although his Repository gets updated occasionally, I'd like to think of this project as a legacy to his project. I hope you enjoy these Overlays, and we would love to meet some new Overlay Creators. Enjoy!
